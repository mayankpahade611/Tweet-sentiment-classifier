#  Tweet Sentiment Classifier

A machine learning web app that classifies the **sentiment** of a tweet as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** using Natural Language Processing and Scikit-learn.  
This project uses **TF-IDF Vectorization**, **Logistic Regression**, and is deployed with **Streamlit**.

> ⚠ Note: The original CSV dataset (`tweet.csv`) has been removed from this repository due to GitHub's 100MB file size limit. See [🔽 Dataset Download Instructions](#-dataset-download-instructions) below.
